                  The legal process to immigrate to America takes too long. People immigrate for a variety of reasons, 
                  and many are time sensitive. Take, for example, Kenya, a woman whose abusive husband was an officer of law in her native country.
                   The influence he had meant the only chance for escape was to get into another country. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Other times large populations seek refuge from war or government violence; Syrians have been 
                  fleeing Syria since violent arrests and “public demonstrations” by their government began in 2011. 
                  Many times though, the issue is something in the middle, not personal, but not large enough to be newsworthy. 
                  For example, crime is rampant and obstetrician violence is a stunning 33.3% in Mexico, 
                  and gun-related violence caused 22.84 deaths per capita in Brazil in 2019 alone. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  America is far from perfect, but it is offering a safety that isn’t found in every country. 
                  Immigrants aren’t coming to go on vacation, they are fleeing for their lives. They cannot afford to
                   wait 2-3 years after making their decision, 
                  but that’s the average time it takes to be approved for a green card. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Living undocumented can be a horrible experience, hiding from U.S. Immigration and 
                  Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and being unqualified for jobs for lack of paperwork, not skill or knowledge. 
                  Choosing this lifestyle should be evidence enough that what they are escaping is worth consideration.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  The laws and policies need to change. It is estimated by the Yale School of Management that the 
                  undocumented immigrant population is between 10 and 12 million. 
                  The national government is preoccupied with other things, but these aren’t just numbers, they’re people’s lives. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  If the laws change to allow for faster acceptance of immigration applications, the country will change 
                  for the better. Those who are currently limited in how they can participate 
                  in society would be freed to contribute to America, to help it become the country they were seeking. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Immigrants are often willing to do whatever work they can find, and they are already very valuable to 
                  the American economy. From 2020 onwards there has been a massive shortage of employees. 
                  Immigrants are not taking jobs from American-born citizens; they are filling the jobs Americans don’t want.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Robert Lerman and Stefanie Schmidt from American University have made the argument that because 
                  undocumented immigrants are filling jobs most Americans are not willing to take, 
                  it would be disastrous to the United States economy if immigrants were to stop entering illegally.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Some people are upset that unemployed Americans seem to be losing in the “competition” for these jobs, 
                  but without undocumented immigrants there would be a labor shortage. According to the Center for Immigration 
                  Studies, the unemployment rate in food preparation jobs is lower than the percent of undocumented immigrants working there. 
                  This shows that even if every American citizen had a job, they alone could not fill all the jobs. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  If more people are allowed to immigrate to America they will benefit the economy and a new system will benefit 
                  their lives. It will give opportunities to millions currently deprived of them.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  One prominent argument against changing immigration laws is that the Development, Relief, and Education for 
                  Alien Minors Act, or DREAM Act, was passed in 2021 and ramifications of that are not completely known. 
                  Law makers want to see the effects before doing more, but that is procrastinating helping an entire demographic.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  The DREAM Act provides an opportunity for those who entered the United States illegally as minors to become American citizens. 
                  Until they do, it grants them benefits reserved for citizens, such as in-state tuition and the right to work.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  The DREAM Act is a huge step forward, but there are millions who came to America over the age of 18 with their whole lives ahead of them, and they can’t be ignored. 
                  Those who believe they should be punished for not following procedures do not understand the situations from which they came. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  The arguments which support updating immigration laws far outweigh the opposite arguments. The agonizingly slow pace of the immigration process is absurd and unnecessary. 
                  Every year congress waits to pass new laws is another year where millions are forced to live in awful and avoidable conditions. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Call for change. Vote for those who will reshape immigration policies. Citizens have the power to make a difference.
                </p>
