                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Packingham v. North Carolina was a court case to decide whether North 
                  Carolina’s law prohibiting registered sex offenders from using social 
                  media was constitutional. Lester Gerard Packingham, the plaintiff of this case, 
                  was a registered sex offender using a Facebook account under a pseudonym. Police saw a 
                  post he made about traffic court and were able to identify the account as belonging to him, 
                  subsequently charging him for the crime. Packingham tried to have the courts dismiss this 
                  charge on the grounds that it was a violation of his First Amendment rights to not be 
                  allowed on social media. Courts denied him, and 
                  Packingham was given a prison sentence, although he had never attempted to contact a minor. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Eventually Packham’s case was brought to the Supreme Court, where the state court’s 
                  ruling was overturned. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that “A fundamental principle 
                  of the First Amendment is that all persons have access to places where they can speak 
                  and listen, and then, after reflection, speak and listen once more. The Court has sought 
                  to protect the right to speak in this spatial context.” He goes on to explain that the 
                  world has changed. In the past it was known that places such as parks were areas to 
                  protest, to defend beliefs, and to have educational debates, and under the First 
                  Amendment no one could be turned away from these public gatherings. Today, people 
                  exercise their freedom of speech and expression online more than in geographical locations, and therefore these online 
                  places of discussion need to be protected, and treated as public places. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  This case has both positive and negative ramifications. First, it does protect First Amendment rights.
                   When someone commits a crime, one of the consequences is that they do lose some of their rights. 
                   However, registered sex offenders should not be giving up their right to freedom of speech when 
                   they are convicted; constitutionally, that right is protected. One of the main purposes of the 
                   Supreme Court is to uphold the Constitution, 
                  and ensure that other laws are not detracting from it, and they were successful in this case.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  The ruling in Packingham v. North Carolina makes it so that social media mimics life in a slightly 
                  more real way. It contributes to an uncensored marketplace of ideas, where everyone has an opportunity 
                  to be heard. Just like in real life, being allowed to speak does not mean anyone will listen to you, but 
                  there is the possibility that everyone will. 
                  It gives people the opportunity to connect with others and share ideas, which is a basic right in this country. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Minors can still be protected, and registered sex offenders restricted, in their use of social media through 
                  other, more specific laws. The Supreme Court acknowledges that states should pass laws against allowing sex 
                  offenders to use websites to gather information about minors or contacting minors. Caring for the safety of 
                  minors is very important, yet 
                  the Supreme Court decided that it can be done in ways that do not interfere with First Amendment rights.
