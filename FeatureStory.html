                  Grace Pope, a student at BYU, went to a PRSSA conference with hundreds of other students and left with a personal 
                  connection to Richard Bagnall, the chair of the International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication, or AMEC. 
                  This wasn’t just luck, Pope knew how to build and maintain connections, and was willing to put in the effort to do so. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Bagnall was introduced to many students at the conference, but in his brief conversation with Pope he made a joke 
                  that she responded to in a humorous way. That single comment from Pope made her stand out, 
                  and throughout the rest of the conference he acknowledged her every time they passed. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Allison Johanson, a lawyer on the hiring team at Kirton McConkie, 
                  shared three tips on how to network successfully in any field without it getting repetitive:
                </p>
                <h5 class="mb-4 text-left">Be friendly and approachable.</h5>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Present yourself well and be willing to talk to people. Often, starting the conversation is the hardest part, so people avoid it or stand 
                  awkwardly looking for someone new to talk to. Instead of looking for someone, talk to everyone, whoever is closest.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  It’s easy to get in the habit of searching out the few people who have powerful connections and wanting to make a good impression. 
                  But the “targets” of that sort of networking notice the ulterior motive, and prefer to connect with more genuine people at the event.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  “As part of the hiring team, people constantly approached me at events and tried to impress me with one or two rehearsed facts,” Johanson 
                  said. “It felt like they saw me as a means to an end, not a person, and I would forget them as soon as they walked away.”
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Ranking people you have the potential to meet can damage future relationships with both those seen as important and those overlooked. 
                  When Pope met Bagnall she had no idea who he was, but she didn’t change how she treated him once she learned. 
                  She treats everyone well, and it allows for genuine conversations instead of stiff interactions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">

                  She treats everyone well, and it allows for genuine conversations instead of stiff interactions.
                </p>
                <h5 class="mb-4 text-left">Be memorable.</h5>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Meeting 100 people is useless if none of them remember you. Make as many connections as are reasonable, and commit to 
                  continuing those relationships. LinkedIn and other social media platforms,
                  or following their professional work, are ways to consistently stay up to date with them. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  If people weren’t unique, and she didn’t enjoy the conversation, Johanson wouldn’t have a reason to remember them. 
                  Many people would introduce themselves with facts that belong on a resume, and she couldn’t keep track of who went to which school or where they had interned before. 
                  Conversations that differed from that mold were more likely to make an impact.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  “Conversations are meant to be two-way,” Johanson said. “I won’t be impressed by facts about you, 
                  I want to find a mutual interest or just have conversation that benefits us both.”
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  For a connection to last longer than the conversation where it is made, it needs to be 
                  mutually beneficial. As the person spearheading the relationship at first it may feel one-sided, but 
                  if it is a relationship worth continuing it will quickly change.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Pope had made a good first impression with Bagnall, but first impressions are not enough to create connections. 
                  Pope was memorable because she continued to talk to Bagnall, learning about his life and sharing about her own. 
                  She was ambitious, happy, and relaxed, which can be a rare combination – a memorable combination. 
                  However, each person is unique, and if they stop trying to fit a mold those differences will make them memorable.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  In an article in October 2022 Forbes taught that one of the most memorable ways to network is to figure out how to be useful. 
                  There are always things that need to be done, and when colleagues 
                  make life a little easier, it’s memorable. Build the connections now, and when needs arise, you’ll be top of mind. 
                </p>
                <h5 class="mb-4 text-left">Start early.</h5>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Cultivate connections before you need the connections. Connections maintained over time are genuine and useful, 
                  whereas connections built for an immediate purpose feel fake. Consistency is key to having a personal network.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Johanson started meeting people and maintaining connections before even getting her first legal internship. 
                  Since then she has worked at multiple law firms and interacted with people from many schools.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  “I’m so grateful I networked with people outside of the firm I originally wanted to work for,” Johanson said. 
                  “As my goals changed it was so much easier to change trajectory already having professional 
                  connections where I wanted to go, not to mention maintaining friendships with my classmates at other firms.”
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Have a plan to both create and maintain relationships. Create relationships regularly, seek out situations to meet people.
                   Maintain relationships regularly, 
                  reserve time each day, just a few minutes, to stay updated and periodically interact with others.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Pope had not gone to the PRSSA conference specifically to network. She planned to take any opportunities that arose, 
                  but she did not need to meet people. She networked proactively, knowing the importance of meeting new people. 
                  No grand job offer came out of her connections, but the potential for future jobs is certainly there. 
                  Connections are not immediate, they must be cultivated, and therefore must exist prior to when they are used.
                </p>
                <h5 class="mb-4 text-left">Be confident.</h5>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Pope used these principles expertly. She was friendly and approachable, allowing for the humorous atmosphere that made her so memorable. 
                  She was talking to Bagnall before finding out who he was or his position, making a good impression with no ulterior motive.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  She was creating relationships without needing something from it, and as a result she was offered future benefits, 
                  such as a personal tour around AMEC if she was interested. When relationships 
                  feel genuine both sides want to help the other, resulting in a mutually beneficial relationship.
                </p>
                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Networking is achievable for everyone, but it takes effort and practice. As you apply new skills and expand your network, 
                  you will get better and better. Networking can boost your career in ways you’ll never expect, but you need to start now!
